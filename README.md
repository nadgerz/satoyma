Steve and Tom's One Year Mapping Application

	This is a long experiment.

	We wanted to create an application that was visual and collaborative,
	using modern technologies and best practices.   One of our main goals
        is to experiment with using best practices as well as to learn more
        about developing a modern single page web app.  Both the front end
        as well as the back end.

	Along the way, we will use (probably):

        Front end:

	* Javascript
	* Angular.js
	* Karma
	* Jasmine
	* Vagrant
	* HTML5
	* CSS3
	* Markdown
	* jQuery
	* Responsive Web Design

        Back end:

	* Groovy
	* Java
	* Findbugs
	* PMD
	* Node.js
	* Vert.x
	* Nodeunit
	* MongoDB
	* Postgres
	* Postgis

        Infrastructure :
	* IntelliJ
	* Travis
	* Github
	* AWS
	* Gradle
	* Git
	* Heroku

We are looking at using Open Street Maps as our background data. [Importing OSM into MongoDB][impmongo]

Questions:

1.  Should we go full javascript?  Use node as the back end or grails or vert.x?
