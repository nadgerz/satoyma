Steve and Tom's One Year Mapping Application

	This is a long experiment.

	We wanted to create an application that was visual and collaborative,
	using modern technologies and best practices.

	Along the way, we will use (probably):

	Javascript
	Angular.js
	Karma
	Jasmine
	Vagrant
	Node.js
	Travis
	HTML5
	CSS3
	Git
	Groovy
	Gradle
	Java
	Github
	AWS
	IntelliJ
	Findbugs
	PMD
	Vert.x
	Nodeunit
	Markdown
	jQuery
	Responsive Web Design
	Heroku
	MongoDB
	Postgres
	Postgis

We are looking at using Open Street Maps as our background data.
