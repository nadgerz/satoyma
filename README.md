Steve and Tom's One Year Mapping Application

	This is a long experiment.

	We wanted to create an application that was visual and collaborative,
	using modern technologies and best practices.

	Along the way, we will use (probably):

	Javascript
	Angular.js
	Karma
	Jasmine
	Vagrant
	Node.js
	Travis
	HTML5
	CSS3
	Git
	Groovy
	Gradle
	Java
	Github
	AWS
	IntelliJ
	Findbugs
	PMD
	Vert.x
	Nodeunit
	Markdown
	jQuery
	Responsive Web Design
	Heroku
	MongoDB
	Postgres
	Postgis
