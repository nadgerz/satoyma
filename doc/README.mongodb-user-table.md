# Just information regarding this branch and how things worked out.

What I want to do here, ideally, is create a Users table in mongodb via BDD/TDD

I want to be able to test for:

    * a running mongod instance, if I am trying to interact with the db
    * load a fixed set of user data from a json file - only do this if we drop/create the table?
    * insert/update/delete entries
    * generate random user data from that site I now forget :) - 
    * learn how to define a table/model using mongoose?
