**Single Page Web Applications:**

[Single Page (Web) Application](http://www.manning.com/mikowski/)

This shows how to build a Single Page (Web) Application [SPA]
without using any Javascript Framework.

It uses Javascript (obviously) and Node.js and MongoDB and given
that is what satoyma is using (well we may use Vert.x instead of Node.js)
it seemed a good fit.

It is not an introductory book, so some knowledge of Javascript is useful.

It really covers the nuts and bolts of doing an SPA from scratch.

Highly recommended!
