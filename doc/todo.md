Just a placeholder for things we need/want to look at:

At the moment, the project is mostly setup and READING :)

o	-	Decide on a Testing Framework for Angular.js and friends... possibly leaning towards Karma and Jasmine?
o	-	Start to build up .gitignore files
o	-	Work on jshint/lint options... make strict!
o	-	Have discussion on code formats - I think this is super important; to reach a consensus.
			Debating having git check code in in a particular format.
			Then maybe we can check out code and format how we like? Hopefully it won't be TOO different!
			Will all probably be IntelliJ biased - sorry :/
o	-	Start on an agreed directory structure
		src?
		log vs logs
		js
o	-	gradle build files... get Tom to start them from scratch
