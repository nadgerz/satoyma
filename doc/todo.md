Just a placeholder for things we need/want to look at:

At the moment, the project is mostly setup and READING :)

* Decide on a Testing Framework for Angular.js and friends... possibly leaning towards Karma and Jasmine?
* Start to build up .gitignore files
* Work on jshint/lint options... make strict!
* Have discussion on code formats - I think this is super important; to reach a consensus.
    Debating having git check code in in a particular format.
    Then maybe we can check out code and format how we like? Hopefully it won't be TOO different!
    Will all probably be IntelliJ biased - sorry :/
* Start on an agreed directory structure
    src?
    log vs logs
    js
* gradle build files... get Tom to start them from scratch
