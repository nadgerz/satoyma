[Backbone.js Documentation](http://backbonejs.org)

From Human Javascript...

"""
This is the biggest lesson I've learned building lots of single page apps. 
Your view (the DOM) should just be reacting to the model state of your 
application. 

For this you could use any number of tools and frameworks. 

I often recommend reading the Backbone documentation to developers 
who are new to these concepts. 

It provides a clear "just JavaScript"â„¢ approach to this and serves as 
a fantastic primer to the problems of building clientside apps.
